# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Kaggle-

## Overview
Welcome to my first Kaggle competition! I'm excited to participate in predicting which passengers were more likely to survive the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. This challenge utilizes passenger attributes such as name, age, gender, and socio-economic class to build a predictive model.

## Current Public Score: 0.773

Dataset
train.csv: Contains details of 891 passengers, including whether they survived or not (the ground truth).
test.csv: Contains similar information for 418 passengers, without survival outcomes (used for predictions).
